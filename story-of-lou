Once upon a time, there was a Japanese electrician who under the threat of destruction of his home and all his belongings
by his psychopathic gardener, wanted to quit his job. But he could not simply
quit his job because he was living with his mother, for whom he had to 
take care. He doesn't have any other sources of income and he is the only 
one who pays the bills. At the same time he has always had a dream which he
kept to himself. He always thought about how to make this dream 
come true. The dilemma between his current job and his dream made him very conflicted.
He soon realized that there was no way he could possibly make his dream happen. Or at least thats what he kept telling himself
